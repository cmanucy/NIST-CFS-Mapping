# NIST-CFS-Mapping
This is a mapping of the NIST CSF Framework to various other standards.  The origin of this document is from NIST - https://www.nist.gov/document/framework-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity-corexlsx - what I have done is modify and enhance it to fit my own needs.

What's different?

I moved a lot of the 'reference standards' into their own columns (ISO 27000 yet to come).  

I also took some other tools focused around NERC CIP mappings and included them as separate sheets in this Excel document.

What does it do?

This spreadsheet should serve as a quick reference for cross mapping NIST CSF (1.x) over to a variety of other standards, including:

ISA 62243 (2-1 and 3-2)
NERC CIP
CIS Critical Controls (v7 and v8)
CCR
C2M2
COBIT 5
NIST 800-53 R5
CISA CPGs (v1.0.0 and v1.0.1)
NRECA 10 Goals

It also includes additional references to tools (both paid and free), information, helpful guidance, training and other resources that can be used to accomplish the component.

If you have other thoughts/ideas/adds, feel free to reach out.  Some of this information is a bit old and on a roadmap to update.
